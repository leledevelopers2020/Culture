Unions are conceptually similar to structures. The syntax to declare/define \n union is also similar to that of a structure. The only differences is in terms of storage. In structure each member has its own storage location, whereas all\n members of union uses a single shared memory location which is equal to \nthe size of its largest data member.
This declares a variable It1 of type union item. This union contains three members each\n with a different data type. However only one of them can be used at a time. This is due to the fact that only one location is allocated for all the union\n variables, irrespective of their size. The compiler allocates the storage that is large enough to hold the largest variable type in the union.
In the union declared above the member x requires 4 bytes which is largest amongst the\n members for a 16-bit machine. Other members of union will share the same memory address.
